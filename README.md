# Description

I am trying to upgrade my packages. Most importantly, NextJS from 10.0.3 to 12.0.3.

This is a working example with my current versions.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@formatjs/intl-getcanonicallocales": "^1.5.6",
    "@formatjs/intl-locale": "^2.4.19",
    "@formatjs/intl-pluralrules": "^4.0.11",
    "next": "10.0.3",
    "react": "17.0.1",
    "react-dom": "17.0.1"
  }
```
